a team at [MIT’s](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)[ ](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)[Media](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)[ ](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)[Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)[ ](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)[and](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)[ ](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)[no](https://www.media.mit.edu/about/overview/)w maintained by its own [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/credits)[ ](https://scratch.mit.edu/credits)[Foundation](https://scratch.mit.edu/credits)[.](https://scratch.mit.edu/credits)

By putting together “puzzle pieces” in Scratch, we can create visual stories,

animations, games, and other programs.

We’ll learn and use programming concepts and ideas, like functions, loops,

condition, and variables.

Even though Scratch uses visual blocks as opposed to textual code, its

programs are based on the same fundamental ideas and use same principles

of computational thinking.





**03.** Sprites - Interface basics

We can go to [Scratch’s](https://scratch.mit.edu/)[ ](https://scratch.mit.edu/)[website](https://scratch.mit.edu/)[,](https://scratch.mit.edu/)[ ](https://scratch.mit.edu/)[click](https://scratch.mit.edu/)[ ](https://scratch.mit.edu/)“Start Creating”,

where we’ll see an interface like this:





**03.** Sprites - Interface basics

On the left side, we have a library of blocks, where we can drag and drop any

combination of them into the middle section, called the block editor, where we’ll build

our project.





**03.** Sprites - Interface basics

On the top right side, we have the stage, where our project will run and be shown to

others viewing or using it.





**04.** Sprites - Naming and positioning

When we create a new project, we see the Scratch cat character, called a **sprite**, which

is just an object that can appear on the stage.

Below the stage, we see all the sprites in our project, and currently we only have the

cat, called “Sprite1”.

We can move our cat around the stage by just clicking and dragging it. Notice that the

values for the position of the sprite changes as we move it around. For example, the x-

value is 177 and the y-value is 42 when the sprite is moved towards the top right:





**04.** Sprites - Naming and positioning





**04.** Sprites - Naming and positioning

It turns out that sprites are located on an x- and y-coordinate grid on the stage,

where the x-value represents how far to the left or right our sprite is, and the y-value

represents how far up or down on the stage it is.

The perfect center of the stage is (0, 0), and positive x-values will move the sprite to

the right, and negative x-values will move it to the left. Similarly, positive y-values will

move the sprite up, and negative y-values will move it down.

We can see the sprite’s current position as x- and y-values, but we can also control

them with blocks in a little bit.

We can also change the x- and y-values of our sprite directly by clicking on the

values and typing in what we want. And we can click on the name of the sprite,

and change it to something else as well. This will help us keep track of our sprites

when we start adding more of them to our project.





**04.** Sprites - Naming and positioning

We can also show or hide each sprite with the toggle labeled “Show”, and change the

size (in percent), or direction, which rotates the cat to face some number of degrees:

When we click on the value for “Direction”, we’ll see a little dial that we can turn,

which will also turn our sprite on the stage.





**05.** Sprites - Adding

Let’s add a new sprite. We can click the button with a little plus in the bottom of the

sprite area, and see some options for adding a new sprite:

For now, we’ll use the main “Choose a Sprite” button, and we’ll see a big list of

sprites that come with Scratch that we can use. We can click on the categories or

use the search box to find something in particular.





**05.** Sprites - Adding

We’ll click on the Fish, and we’ll see that both sprites are now on our stage. We can

move them around so they’re not overlapping.

We also have both sprites in the bottom area, and the one highlighted in blue is the one

that’s selected and the one that we’re working with. We can click on each of them to

change the position or size of them, for example.

We can right-click (or hold the control key and click) our fish, and see a menu with

some options. We can click “duplicate”, and now we’ll have two fish on our stage:





**05.** Sprites - Adding

Then, we can move them around so they’re not overlapping:





**05.** Sprites - Adding

We can see this example at [Sprites](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/507419806/)[.](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/507419806/)





**06.** Sprites - Costumes

Each sprite has a **costume**, which is just the image of what the sprite looks like.

On the top left, we can use the “Costumes” tab:





**06.** Sprites - Costumes





**06.** Sprites - Costumes

We’ll see that our fish has four costumes, “fish-a”, “fish-b”, “fish-c”, and “fish-d”,

and we can select different ones by clicking on them.

For the cat, we have two different costumes, where its legs are in different

positions. By switching between them, we can give the appearance that it ’s

walking.

In the costume editor, we can even add new costumes with the button on

the bottom left, with the plus sign. We can add costumes from Scratch, or

paint our own with the tools in the center.

We can also edit the built-in costumes by selecting them, and using the tools

to change them to how we want them to look.

We can see this example at [Costumes](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/507420136/)[.](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/507420136/)

Finally, we can upload our own photo or image from our computer to use as a

costume.





**07.** Sprites - Sounds

We can use the “Sounds” tab on top to give sounds to sprites:





**07.** Sprites - Sounds

We see that our fish has a “bubbles” sound and an “ocean wave” sound, and if

we select our cat in the sprite panel, we see that it has just one sound, a

“meow” sound.

We can change the built-in sounds, or record or upload our own.





**08.** Sprites -Background

Our stage has a plain white background, so we can click the button in the

bottom right to choose a new backdrop:





**08.** Sprites -Background

Now we’ll see a lot of different backdrops, and we’ll use the underwater one

for our fish.

But our cat is out of place now, so we can click on it in our sprite panel and

use the trash can icon to remove it.

We can flip our yellow and green fish by changing the rotation to negative

90 degrees, but this turns our fish upside-down. It turns out that we can

change the rotation style from all-around (the circle on the left) to left-and-

right (the triangles in the center):





**08.** Sprites -Background





**08.** Sprites -Background

Now our sprite will face only to the left or right.

On the top right, we can click the full-screen icon to see

our stage and sprites in full-screen as well.

We can see this example at [Backdrops](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/507420944/)[.](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/507420944/)





**09.** Sprites -Saving

To save our project so we can keep it and use it later, we can use the File menu

on the top left to save it:

After we save our project, we can load it later by using the “Load from your

computer” option in the same menu.

We can also create an account with Scratch with the “Join Scratch” button

on the top right, which will save our project to Scratch’s website. This will

also let us easily share our project with others.





**10.** Sprites –Next Time

Next time, we’ll start using these code blocks to program our sprites to do

different actions, and even create interactive stories and games based on a

person’s input.
